# Character Cards
This is a tool for creating and rendering cards that display information about
D&D characters. The project comes with an applet intended to be used as a
browser source in video streaming software such as OBS, as well as an editor
for customizing the cards that get generated by the applet.

## How to Use
The index shows an example of how the applet would look in use, and provides
links to the applet and editor.

### Applet
The applet views character cards. It can take the following parameters:
- `datasource=%DATAFILE%`, where `%DATAFILE%` is the path to a card data source file.
- `editor`, which tells the applet to accept input from the editor.
- `manual`, tells the applet not to automatically cycle through cards.

An example for the applet would be, `applet.html?datasource=data/example.js&manual`, which opens the applet with the example data source and without automatically cycling through cards.
