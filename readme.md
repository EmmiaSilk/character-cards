# Character Cards
This project is a proof of concept. The goal is to have cards displaying the
stats and names of a D&D party's characters as a slideshow that can easily be
modified to fit the group.

To change the character data, simply alter the JSON in `datasource.js`,
modifying, adding, or removing character blocks to fit the group.
